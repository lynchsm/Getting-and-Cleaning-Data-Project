Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.1
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 86-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The script "run_analysis.R" performs the following:
======================================
1 Downloads & unzips the datafile 
2 Assigns each dataset to a variable 
3 Aggregates the dataset together
4 Subsets the columns for those that contain mean & standard deviation measurements 
5 Assigns activities to each row based on unique identifier
6 Gives each column a more descriptive name 
7 Groups dataset by activity and subject and provides an average for each column
8 Writes the summarized & cleaned dataset to working directory

Changes in variables from original dataset:
======================================
Acc replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro replaced by Gyroscope
BodyBody replaced by Body
Mag replaced by Magnitude
Input descriptor "Frequency" for columns starting w/ "f"
Input descriptor "Time" for columns starting w/ "t"
